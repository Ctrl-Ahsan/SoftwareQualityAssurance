1. What is the branch he/she worked on (has to be pushed to the repo).
So far I have worked on userUpdate, userUpdate2 and registerPage.

2. What is the progress so far (at least some test cases written, more than 2)
 I have written 3 sets of test cases to test the create product entity. The three test cases represent R4-6, R4-1 and R4-2 of 
assignemnt two requirements. I have only done output coverage tests so far.

3. Any difficulties.
Getting Pytest to run properly caused me a bit of trouble. Additionally, knowing if I had test
enough for each type of test. Finally, a lot most of my tests wouldn't behave how i wanted them to and I will work on fixing this
before the final due date of this friday.

4.what is the plan for the days before the deadline.
These next couple days I will complete all test cases assignined to me in the standup meeting before the start of the sprint.
I will additionally, make the tests I have worked on until now work entirely.
