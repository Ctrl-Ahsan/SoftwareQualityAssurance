1. a5-docker is the branch I've been working on.
2. So far, I've added my portion of code to the a5-docker branch. This includes the db_init.sql, wait-for-it.sh, and other files. I've installed docker on my laptop and started working on creating the image.
3. 1 issue I've run into is the fact that I use an m1 MacBook. I had to install Rosetta 2 on my laptop in order to install and use docker.
4. I plan to finish creating the docker image and help my team members with their sections.
